Multi Planet Clock

Displays the time on a set of different planets and sol-orbiting bodies.

The year for each planet is calculated by the revolutions around the sun since the earth-year 1BC.

The time on each planet is then calculated by the rotational period of each planet.

This is an old project, from 2008/2009 or so
